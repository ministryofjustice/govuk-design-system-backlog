# Ministry of Justice Design System Backlog

This file documents any significant changes we make to the way we organise and run this backlog.

It is not a record of all the changes made to the contents of the backlog.

# How we started

One of our goals is to create a Ministry of Justice Design System which represents the needs of service teams within the Ministry of Justice. The process of building a backlog should be co-created by people in different teams to reflect those needs. So to start with something that could help facilitate those conversations we created a master list of components and patterns.

We have been talking to representatives of different teams, both designers and developers to get their feedback on what we have on the Design System backlog, identifying what is missing, and spotting where there is overlap in work in different departments.

Current user pain points from our research:
- Lack of awareness of the available design resources
- Teams developing new things when someoneÂ´s already solved the problem
- Duplication of effort and inconsistently designed services
- Useful patterns and components are missing
- A lack of clarity regarding the official status of some patterns
- Design resources feels like they're owned by GDS

The idea was that this place could host and help raise visibility on what people are working on, while something in not available in the MoJ Design System. We want to encourage collaboration and avoid duplication by making work visible to others
