# MOJ Design System Community Backlog

## About this repo

This is a place for the MOJ community to coordinate the development of new components and patterns for the [MOJ Design System](https://moj-design-system.herokuapp.com/).

**[View the community backlog](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/moj-design-system-backlog/projects/1)**

## Support

If you have any questions about this backlog you can use the issue comments or use the [#moj-design-system](https://mojdt.slack.com/messages/CH5RUSB27) channel on MOJ Slack.

## Contributing

You can contribute by discussing and [proposing components and patterns](https://moj-design-system.herokuapp.com/community/propose-a-component-or-pattern).

## The future

We want to contribute patterns to the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) in the future.
