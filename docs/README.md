# MOJ Design System Community Backlog

When desiging a service you should. **Start with the [MoJ Design System](https://moj-design-system.herokuapp.com) test and iterate. Resist the urge to make a new thing.**

## About this repo

This is a place for the MoJ Digital & Technology (MoJDT) community to coordinate the cataloging and development of new components and patterns for the [MoJ Digital & Technology Design System](https://moj-design-system.herokuapp.com/).

The initial focus is to catalogue all patterns that are being used in MoJDT so that we can standardise services where possible:

* Her Majesty's Prison & Probation Service (HMPPS)
* Legal Aid Agency (LAA)
* Central Digital (including User Centred Policy Design - UCPD)
* Office of the Public Guardian (OPG)
* Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA)
